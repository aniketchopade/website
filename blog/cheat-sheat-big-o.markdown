# Big-Os

* O(1) - No loops
* O(log n) - logarithmic , mostly for search algorithms
* O(n) - linear loop , one for/while looping n items 
* O(n log n) - linear logarithmic - sorting algorithams
* O( n ^2) - quadratic 
* O( 2^n) - exponential recursive algorithms
* O( n!) - factorial -adding loop for each element

--

* Bubble Sort - the worst of all, never use in production
* Selection Sort - the way we sort ascending and descending numbers, pick up min and keep aside
* Insertion Sort - the way we sort cards in our hands
* Divide and conquer
    - Merge Sort - Break list into granular and then merge. Sort during merging process
    - Quick Sort - Choose pivot and sort entire array around it. If pivot selection is not correct then o(n2)
